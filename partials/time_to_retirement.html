			    		Financial independence is the point at which passive income safely exceeds expenses. "Safely" is determined by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study" target="_blank">the 4% safe withdrawal rate</a>, which is the maximum rate at which you can spend your savings such that you donâ€™t run out in your lifetime. With your assets invested in diversified stock market funds which historically gain on average 7-12% annually, one can safely live off passive income forever.
